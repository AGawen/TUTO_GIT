        <h1>THE GIT RAP</h1>
		<p>yo, this is the git rap
			we gonna do it like this
			we gonna do it like that
			i got ten stacks pushed in my stash
			git stash clear, it was gone like that
			but have no fear cause i bounce right back</p>
			
			<p>so, back to the lesson at hand
git status to determine to the plan
git diff color to see where i am 
i get with git every day i can
this is the git rap and i am the git man
wait you mean li-li-linus, mr linux royal highness
he made git the best he can so you know it is the finest
anyone not using git needs to be reminded its 
imperative to distribute authors of the code
if we didnt have git the linux kernel would probably explode
so says we all even the hypnotoad
the shoulders of giants is where we road
we roll in compliance with the history of code</p>
